        "1. The paper seems to be about why datasets should be tidied and the structure to approach doing so. In addition, the paper will introduce specific tools to help with the tidying process.\n",
        "2. The tidy data standard is meant to accomplish a more efficient way of cleaning data by standardizing the process. This will include a way to look through and analyze the data so that the process in creating the data analysis tools will be easier.\n",
        "3. The first sentence is meant to portray the difference between tidy and messy datasets--in a way, it's expanding upon the \"tidy data standard.\" The first sentence is explaining that tidy data are similar because they've been cleaned in a \"standardized\" way that makes data analysis easier. Messy dataset is messy in its own way because we can never predict which areas of the dataset will need to be cleaned. The second sentence is stating that what we see in the labels of each column for datasets may not actually fully portray its signifance within the dataset. The examples they give are that labels could be seen as an observation or variable, but within the actual data set, may not be what it seems and actually has a different \"definition\". This is just showing the importance of understanding the context of the dataset in order to fully gauge the meaning of the variables and observations.\n",
        "4. Wickham defines values as either quantitative (numbers) or qualitative (words/strings) data that can be sorted into variables or observations. Variables will describe the same trait regarding different subjects, so the example provided by Wickham is height, temperature, or duration. Observations, on the other hand, describes a single subject but the multiple traits that describe it. An example would be the observations that could be made regarding a person.\n",
        "5. Tidy data is defined as a way \"of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure\" which is defining the way in which the data is formatted in order to be analyzed. Tidy data, specifically, is defined so that a variable will form a column while an observation will form a row. In addition, each type of observational unit will form a table. There is one type of tidy data since it standardizes a way of formatting the dataset so that it can be more efficiently utilized by a person or language.\n",
        "6. The 5 most common problems with mess datasets are that column headers are values, not variables names, multiple variables being stored in one column, variables stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units in the same table, and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. For table 4, it's messy because both rows and columns are composed of variables and the column headers don't have a name but have values instead. In order to fix this, we need to \"melt\" the data which means to switch the columns to rows. This means we can fix the problem of having both rows and columns as variables and having column headers that are values.\n",
        "7. Table 11 is messy for a few reason. The first is that there is a lot of empty space throughout which were ommitted in Table 12. The melting part comes from creating column headers of id, year, month, and element. From there, tmax and tmin needed to be roated in order for them to be column headers rather than within the \"element\" column.\n",
        "Overall, table 12 is tidy and \"molten\" because it's the cleaned version of table 11.\n",
        "8. The chicken-and-egg problem relates to the paradoxical situation where the structure of the data and the tools that are created to be most efficient with the structure are interdepedent. Wickham hopes that in the future, we are able to use methodologies from other fields, such as user-testing, ethnography, and talk-aloud protocols, to improve the cognitive side and efficacy of tools for data analysis."
